> “*A compelling way to share you’re doing w/ the world, and get people to do what you want them to do.*”

It's simple af. 

Marketing is the act of buying or selling in a market. Anything you do to sell a product or service in the market is marketing and getting people to take action.

The way to “do” marketing, is to identify a goal and find which path is the most efficient and the fastest to get you there. That's it.

## Example I:

Let’s say u have a company that offers cybersecurity solutions for [Fortune 500 Companies](https://fortune.com/ranking/global500/search/). “Social Media Marketing” won’t be a priority but SEO, Email Marketing and Sales would be a pretty safe bet. (This doesn’t mean u don’t do social media marketing, but is not a priority.)

## Example II:

AI Math Assistant for students, Social Media and Affiliates sounds like the way to go. I mean good luck trying to do 1:1 sales. It's ok at the beginning to test the product but there's **no leverage**.

## The message.

Once you have the strategy. You need to communicate your product, your company, and your vision.

I like to ask myself this question: <ins>If my company were a person, what would it sound like?</ins>

Once you figure that out, now is the time to start doing it. **Whatever you do do a lot of it.**

that's it.
